Description: The CellScore package contains functions to evaluate the cell
   identity of a test sample, given a cell transition defined with a starting 
   (donor) cell type and a desired target cell type. The evaluation is based 
   upon a scoring system, which uses a set of standard samples of known 
   cell types, as the reference set. The functions have been carried out on a 
   large set of microarray data from one platform (Affymetrix Human Genome 
   U133 Plus 2.0). In principle, the method could be applied to any expression 
   dataset, provided that there are a sufficient number of standard samples and 
   that the data are normalized.
